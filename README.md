# Fuzzy Chess
"Fuzzy Chess" is a chess-themed strategy game for PC. In "Fuzzy Chess", unlike classic chess, the success of piece captures is determined using fuzzy logic. A die is rolled when an attacking piece attempts to capture a defending piece, and the die returns a value that determines whether the capture is executed. The die value needed for a successful capture depends on the type of piece attacking vs the type of piece defending. For example, a pawn needs to roll a 6 to capture a king, while a king needs to roll a 1 to capture a pawn (this is an automatic capture). The game features a corps command system, a robust AI, and level selection.   

# Background
"Fuzzy Chess" was developed from January to May 2022 by a team of 7: Nicholas Wile (me), Parker Smith (team lead), Adam Logan, Tyler Williams, Matthew Graham, Devin Pacl, and Cameron Jones. It was our Computer Science Senior / Capstone Project at Kennesaw State University for the Spring 2022 semester with Dr. Ken Hoganson. The project was completed in four sprints that each ended in meeting with the professor to discuss and demonstrate the progression of the project.

# My Role
- Lead game and UI designer: I designed the look of the game, fonts, color palettes, and user interface elements including the menu system, HUD, and other 2D graphics. I also programmed the UI, and developed the visual system to support UI scaling, multiple resolutions, refresh rates, and screen sizes. I also implemented the chess board texture / level selection for players.
- Gameplay and system programming: I implemented the game state manager for defining player, enemy, win, and lose states. I also implemented the fuzzy logic system for determining success of piece captures in the game.
- Unity subject matter expert: I was the only member on the team with prior significant Unity engine experience, so I guided team members on using the technology and helped troubleshoot Unity issues.
- I prepared the sprint documentations and demo presentations.
