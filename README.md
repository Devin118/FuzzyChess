# Fuzzy Chess
A chess-themed strategy PC game where the success of piece captures is determined using fuzzy logic. A die is rolled when an attacking piece attempts to capture a defending piece, and the die returns a value that determines whether the capture is executed. The die value needed for a successful capture depends on the type of piece attacking vs the type of piece defending. For example, a pawn needs to roll a 6 to capture a king, while a king needs to roll a 1 to capture a pawn (this is an automatic capture). The game features a corps command system, a robust AI, and level selection.   

# Background
"Fuzzy Chess" was developed by a team of 7: Nicholas Wile, Parker Smith (team lead), Adam Logan, Tyler Williams, Matthew Graham, Devin Pacl, and Cameron Jones. It was our Computer Science Senior / Capstone Project at Kennesaw State University for the Spring 2022 semester with Dr. Ken Hoganson. 

# My Role
- Lead game and UI designer: I designed the look of the game, fonts, color palettes, and user interface elements including the menu system, HUD, and other 2D graphics. I also programmed the UI.
- Unity subject matter expert: I was the only member on the team with prior significant Unity engine experience, so I guided team members on using the technology and helped troubleshoot Unity issues.
- I implemented the game state manager for defining player, enemy, win, and lose states.
- I implemented the fuzzy logic system for determining success of piece captures in the game.
- I developed the visual system and handled UI scaling and support for multiple resolutions, refresh rates, and screen sizes.
- I implemented the chess board texture / level selection for players.
- I prepared the sprint documentations and demo presentations.
